STEPS USED IN YES/NO RECOGNITION:-

STEP 1 : READING THE INPUT FILE AND CPOYING THE CONTENT TO LONG DOUBLE ARRAY
STEP 2 : READING THE NOISE FILE & CALCULATE DC SHIFT USING NOISE FILE
STEP 3 : FIRST SUBTRACT DC SHIFT FROM DATA ARRAY AND PERFORM NORMALISATION 
STEP 4 : CALCULATE ZCR AND ENERGY OF EACH FRAME
STEP 5 : NOW COMPUTE AVERAGE ENERGY OF WHOLE DATA
STEP 6 : USING AVERAGE ENERGY CALCULATE START MARKER AND END MARKER
STEP 7 : CALCULATE AVERAGE ZCR OF DATA BETWEEN START AND END MARKER
STEP 8 : TRAIN MODEL USING 10 YES FILES AND 10 NO FILES
STEP 9 : FIND RANGE OF ZCR IN YES AND NO
STEP 10 : FOR TESTING CALCULATE ZCR OF TESTING DATA AND ON THE VALUE OF ZCR DECIDE WHETHER IT IS YES OR NO
